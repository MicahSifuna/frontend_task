            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
            <p>While automobiles have offered unparalleled convenience, they have also contributed to environmental challenges.

                  By 2030, societal anxiety and chaos are being driven by unrelenting 
                  technological evolution, causing cyber-crime, generational conflicts 
                  and class polarisation to increase. In addition to this, advancements
                   in AI are threatening to markedly increase competition across 
                   humanity. Due to these pressures, consumers will demand spaces and 
                   experiences that alleviate their anxieties and provide healing 
                   qualities. Transport will no longer be simply a means of getting 
                   from A to B, but also a space for escapism, and the interior spaces 
                   of vehicles will be utilised according to user needs.
